# Interactive Landing Page Project
## Project Features
In this project, I have created a multi-section landing page which dynamically builds the navigation links from the section data attributes. The `buildNow()` function will loop through each section and create a list item.

## Interactivity
### Which Section is Currently Being Viewed?
I have used the Intersection Observer API to identify which section is visible in the viewport and have added an `active` class to illustrate this to the user.
